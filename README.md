## Purpose
The purpose of this homework was to take mouse data from mice given a particular drug regimen and find various statistical
measures about tumor volume. This project builds on previous manipulation of data frames using pandas. New tasks that were
included in this assignment included cleaning the data before analyzing, performing statistical analysis of correlation, and
plotting results using the Matplotlib library.
